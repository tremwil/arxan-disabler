//! Provides utilities to hook around SteamStub V3.1 (as versionned by Steamless).
//!
//! SteamStub is used in DS3 and SDT. We must hook around it to be able to extract
//! the binary's original entry point (which in DS3's case will be the Arxan entry point)
//! to then apply the arxan patches on that one.
//!
//! Detouring SteamStub is fairly straightforward. The structure of a stubbed entry point
//! is as follows:
//!
//! ```x86asm
//! CALL steamstub_entry
//! steamstub_entry:
//! {push general purpose registers}
//! {align RSP}
//! CALL steamstub_main
//! {write RAX to call return address}
//! {pop general purpose registers}
//! RET
//! ```
//!
//! `steamstub_main` performs code integrity checks, so we can't simply hook it.
//! However, we can do the following:
//! 1. Hook at the first CALL
//! 2. Follow `steamstub_entry` until we get to the second call
//! 3. Call it ourselves with the usual MSVC x64 calling convention
//! 4. We now have the original (Arxan) entry point as the return value!
//!
//! Which makes it quite easy to work around.
